```
add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG] s/SPORT pc/POSTALCODE
```

```

![Adding a Friend](images/add_command.png)

> ⚠️ **Notes**:
> * Name: Names are case-insensitive (e.g., the names, Somneel and somneel, are the same and will not be allowed when adding a contact).
> * Adding a contact places them in the alphabetically sorted position in the list.
> * "s/o" will not be accepted as part of a name, we recommend you enter this part of your contact's name as "s_o", "so" or even "s o" instead.
> * Postal Code: Only valid Singapore postal codes are accepted.
> * Sport: Only valid sports from "Valid Sports List" are allowed. You can add valid sports to this list by using the `createsport` command.
> * Tag: Tags are optional. You can add as many tags as you want to a contact (e.g., `t/bestfriend t/colleague`). Tags help you categorize your contacts.

### List All Contacts

View all your contacts in one place.

**Format**:
```
list
```

This displays all your contacts in the left panel, sorted by alphabetical order.

![Listing All Friends](images/list_command.png)

> 💡 **List Tips**:
> * You should run this command after adding, deleting or editing contacts to see the updated list.
> * You should also run this command after running find or findsport commands to view the full list.

### Edit Contact

```

This updates the 2nd contact in your current FitFriends list with a new name, phone number, address, and postal code.

![Editing a Friend](images/edit_command.png)

> 💡 **Edit Tips**:
> * Editing a tag will remove all existing tags as tags cannot be added sequentially (e.g., `edit t/bestfriend` followed by `edit t/colleague` will result in only the `colleague` tag remaining).
> * Adding a contact places them in the alphabetically sorted position in the list.
> * "s/o" will not be accepted as part of a name, we recommend you enter this part of your contact's name as "s_o", "so" or even "s o" instead.
