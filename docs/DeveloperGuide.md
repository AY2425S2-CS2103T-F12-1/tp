### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](diagrams/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Game Creation feature
The `addgame` command creates and adds a new `Game` object into the addressbook. Each `Game` object has 4 attributes: `Sport`, `LocalDateTime`, `Location` and `UniquePersonList` which are specified using the prefixes g/, dt/, pc respectively with their corresponding values. As a `Game` object is initialised without any participants at first, the `UniquePersonList` field is not mutable during initialisation and thus not included in the command.

#### Implementation 
The `Game` object is added into a `UniqueGameList` object whenever `addgame` command is called. This mirrors the `Person` object and `UniquePersonList` object interaction very closely. These are shown on the User Interface via fxml code. Subsequently, the writing to and reading from the addressbook.json which stores the data is facilitated using JsonAdaptedGame and JsonAdaptedPerson which helps to convert the information to and from json readable format.

### Game Deletion feature
Similar to `addgame` feature

### Global Sports List Management feature

#### Overview

The Global Sports List Management feature allows users to manage a central repository of valid sports that can be assigned to contacts. This feature enhances the sports functionality of the application by providing a consistent set of sports across all contacts.

#### Implementation

The implementation includes several components:

1. **Sport class enhancement**: The `Sport` class has been extended to maintain a static set of valid sports and provide methods for manipulating this set.

2. **UserPrefs integration**: The global sports list's file path is stored in `UserPrefs`, allowing the path to be persisted and retrieved across application sessions.

3. **File storage**: The global sports list is saved to and loaded from a JSON file, ensuring persistence between application runs.

4. **Command implementation**: Three new commands (`CreateSportCommand`, `ListSportsCommand`, and `DeleteSportCommand`) have been implemented to manage the global sports list.

Here's an overview of how the feature works:

![GlobalSportsListSequenceDiagram](images/GlobalSportsListSequenceDiagram.png)

1. On application startup, the `MainApp` class loads the global sports list from the file path specified in `UserPrefs`.
2. When a user adds a new sport using `CreateSportCommand`, the sport is added to the valid sports list in the `Sport` class and saved to the file.
3. The `ListSportsCommand` displays all available sports in alphabetical order with indices.
4. The `DeleteSportCommand` removes a sport from the global list by its index in the alphabetically sorted list.
5. When the application is closed, the global sports list is saved to ensure persistence.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Storage of global sports list**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the sports list in a separate JSON file.
  * Pros: Separation of concerns, easier to manage and update independently from contacts.
  * Cons: Requires additional file I/O operations.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the sports list as part of the UserPrefs.
  * Pros: Single file for all user preferences, potentially simpler implementation.
  * Cons: Bloats the UserPrefs object, especially as the sports list grows.

**Aspect: Management of sports list**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a static set in the Sport class.
  * Pros: Easy to access from anywhere in the codebase, consistent validation.
  * Cons: Static state can be more difficult to test.

* **Alternative 2:** Store in Model as a field.
  * Pros: Follows the architectural pattern more closely, easier to test.
  * Cons: Requires passing the model to more components, potentially complicating the design.

**Aspect: Command structure for deleting sports**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have two separate usages for `deletesport` command (with and without sport name).
  * Pros: Intuitive naming, as both commands deal with deleting sports.
  * Cons: Could cause confusion due to the dual behavior.

* **Alternative 2:** Use separate commands like `deleteglobalsport` and `deletepersonsport`.
  * Pros: Clear distinction between different operations.
  * Cons: More commands to learn, potentially less intuitive naming.

#### Future enhancements:

* **Categorization**: Group sports by type (e.g., team sports, individual sports).
* **Popularity tracking**: Track which sports are most commonly used across contacts.
* **Sport details**: Add additional information like required equipment or typical venue types.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts
* has a need for frequent sporting activities with friends
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage contacts faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
so as to reduce the hassle when organizing sports meetups.
