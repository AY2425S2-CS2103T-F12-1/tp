### Project: AddressBook Level 3

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the HelloCommand feature.
    * What it does: Allows the user to use the "hello" command to receive a greeting from the application.
    * Justification: This feature provides a simple way for users to test if the application is responsive and functioning correctly.
    * Highlights: This enhancement required understanding of the command pattern used in AB3, including how to create a new command class, update the parser, and add tests.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2425s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=isaacchua0309)
