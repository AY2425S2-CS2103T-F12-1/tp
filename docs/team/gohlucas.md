### Project: FitFriends

Fitfriends is a desktop address book application where the user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 12 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add sports to a contact.
  * What it does: allows the user add sports to a contact one or more at a time. 
  * Justification: This is a core feature of the product as it is a sports based address book.
  * Credits: *reused idea from the tags field present in address book 3.*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find contacts by sport.
  * What it does: allows the user to find contacts by sport in addition to the existing find by name command.
  * Justification: This feature logically makes sense to include as our address book is sports based.
  * Credits: *reused idea from the find command present in address book 3.*

* **New Feature**: Added the view functionality for sports in a contact.
  * What it does: allows the user to view the sports added to a contact.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can see what sports each of their contact plays.
  * Credits: *reused idea by adapting attributes into .fxml files such as PersonListCard.fxml and PersonListPanel.fxml from address book 3*

* **New Feature**: Added the view functionality for games.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Credits: *reused idea from the existing .fxml files such as PersonListCard.fxml and PersonListPanel.fxml from address book 3*
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete games.
  * What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add members to games.
*
