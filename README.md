## Prerequisites

1. **JDK 17** installed
2. **IntelliJ IDEA** (updated to the latest version)

## Setup Instructions
1. Open Intellij IDEA
  * If you're currently inside another project, close it by selecting `File` > `Close Project`
2. Configure IntelliJ to use JDK 17:
  * Follow [this guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk) to select JDK 17
  * Set **Project language level** to `SDK default` in the same dialog.
3. Run the Placeholder file:
  * Locate the file named `PLACEHOLDER_FILE_FOR_NOW`
  * right-click it, and select `Run FitFriends.main()`

If the setup is successful, you'll see

```
Hello from
FITFRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
```

**Important:**
Do not rename or move Java files out of the default location (src/main/java). Tools like Gradle rely on this structure.
